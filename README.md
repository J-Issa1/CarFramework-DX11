# DirectX 11 Racing Game Framework

A Engine Framework displaying the basics behind a car racing game.

Included in the project are:

* Player controlled car.
* AI controlled car.
* Simulated real-life physics (gravity, sliding, acceleration).
* Bounding Sphere Collision.

# The Player

The player is able to control the main car and they are able to move around the track freely. In order to represent a similar notion to real-life car, I have included a basic gearing system. 

# AI

In order to differentiate the AI car from the player, I decided to make the AI a blue car compared to the player's orange. The Ai car moves around the track via waypoints, which can be edited in a seperate txt file. This file is titled 'waypoints.txt'.
